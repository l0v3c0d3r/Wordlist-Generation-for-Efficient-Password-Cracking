# Wordlist-Generation-for-Efficient-Password-Cracking
This is a simple python script that generates a wordlist of all possible combinations of words, symbols, and numbers, within a specified minimum and maximum length. It uses the "tqdm" library to display a progress bar while the words are being generated, and "termcolor" to display a message in green when the words have been saved to a file called "wordlist.txt".

# Requirements
Python 3
tqdm
termcolor

# Installation
pip install tqdm termcolor
# Usage
python wordlist_generator.py


You will be prompted to enter the minimum and maximum length for the words in the wordlist. The script will then generate all possible combinations of words, symbols, and numbers within that length range and save them to a file called "wordlist.txt".

# Customization
You can add or remove words, symbols, or numbers in the script by editing the words, symbols, and numbers variables.
